        <p>I have a passion for using data to inform decisions that lead to product development and program success. With a background in social work and pre-medical sciences, as well as experience as a clinician in varied settings, I bring a unique perspective on human-centered design thinking. I possess a breadth of knowledge and skills in computational thinking, cross-functional collaboration, and leadership. As a self-motivated learner and driven professional, I have a demonstrated history of quickly adapting to diverse environments and challenges and performing successfully.</p>
